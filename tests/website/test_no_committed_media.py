"""No video in git, and no new large binaries either.

A recording re-cut after every UI change is a new blob, and git keeps every
one of them forever: the repository was carrying ~11 MB of MP4 in a 40 MB pack
before these moved to the demo host, with more queued in an open PR. The pages
link to https://catalyst.openelis-global.org/media/<name> instead, which the
deploy writes and Caddy serves.

This guard exists because the previous arrangement was also deliberate, and it
still drifted -- landing/media held symlinks specifically "to avoid committing
duplicate binaries", which kept the count down but not the bytes out.
